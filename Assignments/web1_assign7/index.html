           <p>Folklore about the owl goes far back into history. To the Greeks the owl was the favorite creature of Athene, the Goddess of Wisdom. The Greeks revered the owl and protected them. Owls were encouraged to live in their temples and it inhabited the Acropolis in great numbers. They believed that the gods gave the owl a magical inner light which gave them the ability to see in the dark. To have an owl fly over an army before battle was sign of impending victory.</p>
