  <h1>Home Decoration Tips</h1>
     <ul class="list1">
         <li>Set the tone at the front door: If you want your house to make a great first impression, paint the front door a fun, glossy hue. "Red is a lucky color in many cultures," says Lara Allen-Brett, a New Jersey-based stager.</li>
         <li>Keep wall colors light and neutral: Stick to colors like beige or gray, especially on the first floor, where flow is important. "You want to minimize jarring transitions," says Breining. Neutral walls give you the greatest decorating flexibility, allowing you to easily switch up your accessories.</li>
         <li>Hang at least one mirror in every room: Put mirrors on walls perpendicular to windows, not directly across from them. Hanging a mirror directly opposite a window can actually bounce the light right back out the window.</li>
         <li>Anchor rugs under furniture feet: Follow these basic rules for an area rug: "In a living room, all four legs of the sofa and chairs in a furniture grouping should fit on it; the rug should define the seating area," says Breining. "At the very least, the front two legs of the sofa and chairs should rest on it," he adds.</li>
         <li>Call in a pro to declutter: The longer you live in a house, the less you see the mess over time. Sometimes you need a fresh pair of eyes.</li>
         <li>Use visual tricks to raise the ceiling: If your ceilings are on the low side, paint them white to make the room feel less claustrophobic. Hang curtains higher than the windows, suggests Allen-Brett, to trick your eye into thinking the room is taller.</li>

Quarterback Vernon Adams returns after a one-game respite, where the Canadian Football League suspended Adams for removing the helmet of Winipeg's Adam Bighill, then striking the line-backer on the chin with it. He could have applealed the suspension and continued playing until the process wa heard at alater date.  The Als might have continued winning and secured a playoff place. Instead he sat out last week against Brish Columbia and Montreal lost by two points.</p>

  <h1>The Last Word in Books</h1>

         <h6 class="booktitle">The German Girl by Armando Lucas Correa</h6>
         <p>   
            In 1939, the German ship St. Louis set sail from Hamburg for Havana carrying more than 900 passengers, most of them German Jewish refugees, escaping from the Nazi regime. Correa’s debut novel follows one of those passengers, a 12-year-old girl named Hannah Rosenthal, as she and her rich, influential family hope to start a new life in Havana. But when they arrive, the St. Louis and its passengers are refused entry. Hannah and her mother manage to debark, but most of the other passengers—including Hannah’s father and her best friend Leo—are forced to stay aboard. The ship’s passengers were refused entry into America and Canada as well, eventually forced to return to Europe. Seventy years later, Hannah’s grandniece receives a package from her elderly aunt, who is finally ready to tell her family’s story. Correa’s novel is a timely reminder of the plight of refugees, and the real consequences of denying them aid, but the story itself is lukewarm—a tragedy that never complicates or deviates from its expected trajectories. Hannah never stops pining for Leo, and she and her mother shun other Jewish people while simultaneously isolating themselves from Cuban life. There is also a noticeable lack of detail concerning Jewish culture. Though the novel covers an important piece of history, the story of the Rosenthals never quite comes together.

         <h6 class="booktitle">Heads you Win by Jeffrey Archer</h6>
         <p>
             Leningrad, Russia, 1968. Alexander Karpenko is no ordinary child, and from an early age, it is clear he is destined to lead his countrymen. But when his father is assassinated by the KGB for defying the state, he and his mother will have to escape from Russia if they hope to survive. At the docks, they are confronted with an irreversible choice: should they board a container ship bound for America, or Great Britain? Alexander leaves that choice to the toss of a coin.
        </p>
        <p>
           In a single moment, a double twist decides Alexander’s future. During an epic tale of fate and fortune, spanning two continents and thirty years, we follow his triumphs and defeats as he struggles as an immigrant to conquer his new world. As this unique story unfolds, Alexander comes to realize where his destiny lies, and accepts that he must face the past he left behind in Russia.
