      <p>Plants are living things. They are made up of cells.They need soil, air,water and sunlight to live. Their leaves move to catch the sun and their roots move to get water.  Their seeds can be carried by animals or blown by the wind.</p>

          <h2>Plant Adaptations</h2>
          <p>Plants have adaptations to help them survive (live and grow) in different areas. Adaptations are special features that allow a plant or animal to live in a particular place or habitat.</p> 
          <p>These adaptations might make it very difficult for the plant to survive in a different place. This explains why certain plants are found in one area, but not in another. For example, you wouldn't see a cactus living in the Arctic. Nor would you see lots of really tall trees living in grasslands. </p>
