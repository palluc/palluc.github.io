    <p class="column right">
     One of the keys to keeping a lab healthy is to prevent illnesses from taking hold of your dog. This preventative care consists of having your lab vaccinated, going for yearly checkups, and making sure your lab gets enough exercise.

    <p class="column right"> 
    Labrador Retriever nutrition is all about making sure your lab has a well balanced diet, so feeding your Lab a well balanced meal is as important as making sure you eat well. You should buy the best quality dry food you can that will give your lab a well rounded diet with supplement he needs.  In addition to the dog food, you may also give him a multivitamin such as Omega 3 oil and occasional liver tablets which are one of the best treats you can give your dog.
