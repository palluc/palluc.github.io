         Dogs have lived with humans for centuries, guarding us, herding our animals, and helping us to hunt. Nowadays they are mainly used for companionship.
          
         Having a dog in your life can be a wonderful experience. Apart from the love and companionship, dog owners receive health benefits, typically living longer than those who don’t own dogs.

        <h3>The Labrador's Origins</h3>
        <p>
        The Labrador Retriever is considered an English breed, even though the name suggests that it may come from the part of Canada know as Newfoundland and Labrador.
        </p>
         
        <p>
        Early ancestors of the breed were from Newfoundland, and this resulted from the importing of dogs from England and Europe.  The earliest dogs were developed for all-purpose retriever and fisherman's dog in Newfoundland and had come there when the British settled there in the late 1500s.  The cold waters around Newfoundland made it worthwhile for fishermen to travel there from France, Spain, and Portugal.  Along with these settlers, then came the retrievers for there working skills and companionship. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        During the 1800s, the breed was bred to have a certain body shape, look and color so that it would serve a function and purpose.  So at the time, it produced to two types of dogs, (1) the Newfoundland and (2) Labrador, which both assisted in fishing tasks, and the Labrador was also a good gundog for hunting.

       <h3>Thinking About Getting a Dog</h3>
        
        <p>Before getting a dog, evaluate the implications of dog ownership.  It requires a time commitment, has its challenges, and is a long-term commitment, and has expenses bound to it.</p>
        
        <p>Make sure you really want a dog, they can be quite intrusive on your lifestyle. They can be energetic, messy, strong-willed and noisy.  Find dogs very cute is much different than owning one - playing with them and looking after one is a whole different ballgame.</p>
                 
        <p> If you are thinking of getting a puppy, then you would need to puppy-proof your home, visit the veterinarian regularly, feed Your puppy properly, and train your puppy.</p>
                 
        <p>You will have to invest lots of time in your dog, for instance setting out time in your schedule for regular walks. Dogs need lots of attention and when they don’t get it, then they become very challenging to manage.</p>
