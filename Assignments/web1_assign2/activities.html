   <p>
      The Labrador Retriever was bred to be a close-working, personal hunting dog - to stay close to his owner/handler until asked to go retrieve a shot bird. The important point here is that the Lab (a close-working hunting dog) is bred to look to his handler for commands. This is true also for training and doing all sort of activities with your lab.  Good obedience skills are important in controlling your dog, and you will find that your lab is actually an enjoyable dog to train.

   <h3>Basic Training Commands</h3>
   
   <p>
      Some basic commands that will help your lab become and well-trained dog are:
      <ul>
          <li>sit: helps prevent a jumpy lab to jump on visitors.</li>
          <li>stay: the stay command comes in handy with the sit and down commands - to stop the lab from running out into the street, or from eating your whole dinner at supper time.</li>
          <li>down: is used to settle an excited lab, or from barking (it physically hard for a dog to bark in the down position).</li>
          <li>come: Good command to have when your lab is loose and off-leash.</li>
      </ul>
