	   <section class="santa-elves-sub">
		<p>The elves are intelligent and highly skilled. They help Santa to design and make toys and deal with the millions of requests children send Santa every year. Without the Elves, Santa Claus and Mrs Claus will not have been able to make their Christmas dream reality.</p>
		<img src="images/santas_elf.jpg" alt="Santa-Elf" />
		<p>Hundreds of years later the original elves still work with Santa at the North Pole. They make the magic of Christmas come alive every year for children around the world.</p>

Friendly and good hearted, he is entrusted with one of the most important jobs. He is the Administrator of the “Naughty or Nice List”, so you definitely want to be on his side.</p>
			<p>He has developed an elaborate computer system that updates each child’s Naughty or Nice rating five times a minute, all year around.</p>

			<p>By the time he was a boy of 103, he had carved millions of wooden trains, cars, dinosaurs and other toys. Bushy is now the head Toy Maker for Santa and keeps on developing his famous toy making machine to meet children’s endless demand for new toys.</p>

			<p>Shinny is the leader of the all the Elves and Santa’s oldest and most trusted friend. In fact, he co-founded the Magic Workshop with him! Everyone puts up with his moodiness because without the old Shinny Upatree, there wouldn’t be a Village, Workshop, Christmas and maybe not even  Santa.</p>

		<article id="openslau" class="elf">
			<h2>Wunorse Openslae</h2>
			<p>One of the few old native Nordic Elves, Wunorse is in his middle years, around 600 years old. Akin to his Viking ancestors he is tall and strong with long blonde hair that he wears in thick braids. He wears dozens of tiny jingle bells sewn onto his clothes, so the enchanting sound of magic Christmas bells follows him everywhere.</p>
			<p>In charge of the reindeer, Wunorse is also a true inventor and craftsman, and he always carries with him a pencil and notepad  for doodling, sketching and dreaming up new inventions. It was him who long ago created Santa’s magic sleigh.</p>
